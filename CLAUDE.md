# Project Guidelines

## Interaction Rules

- When multiple valid approaches exist, present all options to the user and let them decide before making any changes.

## Commit Style

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`).
- The first line of the commit message must be all lowercase.
- Do not add Co-Authored-By trailers to commit messages.

## Changelog

- Track changes in `CHANGELOG.md` using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.
- Update the changelog as part of each commit when applicable.
